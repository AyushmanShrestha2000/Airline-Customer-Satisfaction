# Airline Passenger Satisfaction Prediction

# Project Overview
This project uses machine learning to predict the passengers level of satisfaction during their flight. The model uses different features from Kaggle dataset. The Random Forest model predicts the most accurate results among other models.

# Features 
- Interactive Dashboard
- Data Exploration
- Passenger Analysis
- Model Training: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVM, KNN and K-Means
- Satisfaction Prediction

# Technologies Used: Streamlit, Python 
- Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, Random Forest
- Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Plotly, Seaborn
